Using the Find The Penguins starter files, create a wack-a-mole style game to find all the penguins before the dreaded Yeti makes an appearance. Once the Yeti is found, the game should reset and be ready for another round. Add the following components to complete the project:

Score!
Add a score box that adds up the number of Penguins you can find before the Yeti shows up. Once the yeti is found, the score should be reset.
Bonus: See if you can make a High Score that remembers the highest score achieved during that session (does not need to maintain state once the browser is closed).


Randomize!
Find a way to randomize the placement of the penguins/yeti. 
Tip: You can use the Shuffle example code as a template to create this feature.


Stay, penguin, stay!
Use JavaScript and/or jQuery to make the penguins stay up when clicked and disappear when the yeti is awoken.


Real squeaks, squawks, and roars!
If you feel like your penguin game is lacking a certain level of auditory awesomeness, try adding some sound effects to each click.
